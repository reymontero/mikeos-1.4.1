1.4.1 (20 July 2008)
--------------------

# New system call: os_dump_registers (displays the contents of
  AX, BX, CX and DX in hexadecimal format)

# System call vectors added for os_print_space, os_show_cursor and
  os_hide_cursor, so that they're accessible to user programs

# os_modify_int_handler now clears the interrupt flag on entry,
  and sets it on exit

# Some single-line labels didn't have comments, triggering warnings
  with some versions of NASM -- fixed



1.4.0 (15 July 2008)
--------------------

# System call for debugging: os_dump_string, shows ASCII text and
  hexadecimal dump

# New system calls for converting numbers to text: os_print_digit,
  os_print_1hex, os_print_2hex, os_print_4hex, os_long_int_to_string

# New system calls: os_set_time_fmt and os_set_date_fmt to determine
  output of os_get_time_string and os_get_date_string respectively

# More system calls: os_get_int_handler, os_print_space, os_long_int_negate

# Bootloader: Buffer now 8K from end of loader, removed unnecessary disk
  reset calls, simplify FAT cluster calculation, FAT fixes

# File selector now exits on Esc keypress (PCXVIEW.BIN updated accordingly)

# New DOS function, 35h - get interrupt vector

# Updated FAT code in syscalls.asm as per bootloader fixes

# Minor changes and comments to string functions

# File selector limited to 14 names to avoid overflow down the screen

# os_get_file_list should better handle floppies made on Windows

# os_program_load will fail if program is too large

# os_file_selector now shows cursor when finished

# mikedev.inc's system call list now categorised

# New system variables section in os_main.asm, currently holding
  settings for time and date formatting

# testzone.asm added in source directory - a place for trying out quick
  code snippets, accessible via 'TEST' in the CLI

  where AX = filename and CX = location in RAM to load file; returns
  BX = size of file loaded

# New system call: os_execute_program: runs code located at 100h

# New system call: os_get_cursor_pos -- returns DH = row of cursor
  and DL = column

# System call vectors at the start of os_main.asm cleaned up: now
  they are simple jmp instructions rather than call/ret sequences

1.0.0 (16 September 2007)
-------------------------

# Restructured directory layout: bootloader (renamed bootload.asm)
  and kernel now both in 'source' directory; new 'doc' directory

# 'build' and 'make_disks' scripts merged into a single script
  called 'build-linux.sh'; BUILD.BAT renamed DOSBUILD.BAT

# New os_file_selector: pops up a dialog box for selecting a file;
  result is a zero-terminated 11-char string pointed to by AX

# New system call: os_string_truncate -- cuts string down to specified
  number of characters from start

# New system call: os_bcd_to_int -- converts binary coded decimal
  numbers into integers

# New system call: os_get_time_string -- generates a string with
  the current time (eg '20:41')

# os_string_chomp now strips leading spaces as well as trailing

# os_print_blank_line renamed to os_print_newline

# os_int_to_string updated -- now based on a public domain routine
  that handles full 16-bit registers

# CLI now strips spaces with os_string_chomp before checking for blank
  lines -- stops it complaining that ' ' (space) is not a valid program

# os_string_strip and show_files now use os_buffer as a temporary store,
  rather than their own strings (reduces kernel size by 512 bytes)

# os_input_string fixed so that backspaced chars are zeroed-out

# os_int_reboot internal call added, which reboots the machine
  via the keyboard controller

# Removed 'API version' from start of os_main.asm; kernel code now
  starts at 0x8000 (bootloader updated accordingly)

# Added os_get_api_version which returns the current API version,
  as defined at the top of os_main.asm, in AL

# Removed CLI_VER from os_cli.asm -- it's not going to be updated
  outside of MikeOS so a single global version number is simpler

# Changed 'REBOOT' to 'EXIT' in os_cli.asm -- now it doesn't
  reboot but exits cleanly with a 'ret'

# CREDITS.TXT added to list people involved in the project



0.40 (16th January 2007)
------------------------

CHANGES BY PETER NEMETH:

# os_syscalls.asm renamed to syscalls.asm, to support the DOS 8.3
  filename character format (NASM could not find certain files)

# BUILD.BAT added for DOS users

# Divide by zero handling (int 0h) added

# Drive descriptor fixed in bootsector and some features added;
  now it will not hang the system if there is a boot failure

# Before loading a DOS program, save and clean up registers

# DOS exit call fixed: does not restart the OS, and programs
  can exit with error codes

# DOS 'get date' interrupt added; now returns the current date

# Some rets replaced with irets

# DOS Ctrl+Break handler added; not yet working (IRQ 9 doesn't
  call int 0x1B)

# DOS print character via printer added

# Some helper routines added for DOS

# DOS CP/M compatible routines added

# DOS reset disk added

# DOS set/get current drive added

# DOS set date function added

# DOS set/get time function added

# DOS functions sorted by function number

# DOS unimplemented interrupt call fixed; now only exits from
  program and display message, not restart OS

# DOS serial port and modem support interrupt added;
  read and write from STDAUX (COM1)

# DOS interrupt flush buffer and read fixed; now really flush the
  buffer before read


CHANGES BY MIKE SAUNDERS:

# gfxdemo.asm fixed to quit properly

# DOS set vector routine added

# Added mini Program Segment Prefix block to os_app_data in
  os_main.asm -- needs to be done properly, but VisiCalc
  now starts up



0.30 (12th November 2006)
-------------------------

# New command line interface mode, currently featuring DIR, HELP,
  CLS, PROMPT, VER and EXIT inbuilt commands. Also trims input
  (eg you can enter 'hello' to run HELLO.BIN on the disk)

# os_alert_dialog renamed os_dialog_box due to new feature: multiple
  button support. If DX = 1 when called, it presents two buttons
  (OK and Cancel) with the selection returned in AX

# New system call: os_string_compare -- takes two strings and sets
  the carry flag if they're the same

# New system call: os_string_chomp -- removes trailing spaces
  at the end of a string

# New system call: os_string_strip -- removes character specified
  in AX from the string in SI

# Kernel source split into multiple files for easier editing, based
  around os_main.asm which includes the rest. These kernel files
  are now in kernel/, with the bootloader in bootloader/

# os_program_load now sets carry flag if program not found, instead
  of bailing out to os_fatal_error, and also returns from a call

# os_program_load can clear the screen before loading a program if
  BX = 1. Useful for the file selector dialog

# Changed os_pause to use BIOS call (needs testing)

# Fixed zero-termination bug in os_string_copy

# MikeOS programs that include mikedev.inc can now access the
  8K scratchpad buffer via os_buffer

# Moved DOSTEST.ASM, for testing DOS compatibility, into the
  programs/ directory (so that it's automatically built)

# Bootloader now has error messages, rather than just freezing

# Split up the assemble and disk-image scripts to avoid loopback
  mounting errors, and simplify editing

# Various small cleanups and fixes



0.25 (27th October 2006)
------------------------

# New system call: os_modify_int_handler

# Removed DOS compatibility interrupt handlers from bootloader,
  replaced with code in kernel using os_modify_int_handler

# System call for os_get_file_list routine added

# Music keyboard demo app no longer uses 100% CPU



0.24 (25th October 2006)
------------------------

# Released on SourceForge
